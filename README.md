# GithubPrideFlags
this is just a comp of pride flags you can make on github, feel free to send me suggestions


how to make one:

get the file extensions of the pride flags and:

the lazy way: add 100 zeroes, then add/remove according to their position on the flag (for the bi one it'd be 101 zeroes for the top, 100 for the middle and 99 for the bottom)

the funny way: try to write a working program on those langs
